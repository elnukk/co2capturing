# A Magical Fish Captures CO2 in the Ocean

Ocean acidification is a big problem that we need to tackle in order to prserve marine life. Here, I built an underwater robot simulation to travel across the ocean efficiently and find spots to 'capture' CO2. The goal of the project is to apply robotics techniques to find CO2 concentrated areas in the sea and efficiently navigate to the chosen spots.
